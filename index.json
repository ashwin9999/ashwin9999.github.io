Software developers work with software that is comprised of numerous source code files. This requires frequent switching between project artifacts during program understanding or debugging activities. Additionally, the amount of content contained within each artifact can be quite large and require scrolling or navigation of the content. Current approaches to eye tracking are meant for fixed stimuli and struggle to capture context during these activities. iTrace overcomes these limitations allowing developers to work in realistic settings during an eye tracking study. The iTrace architecture is presented along with several use cases of where it can be used by researchers. A short video demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/AmrLWgw4OEs.

I led the development of iTrace-Eclipse and iTrace-Chrome which were plugins for Eclipse IDE and Google Chrome that would gather the eye gazes using an Eye Tracker and map them to the elements on the screen. This was particularly useful to analyze the differences between a professional programmer and a novice programmer while fixing bugs (by analyzing the elements they look at during fixing bugs). While the code for the project is private, an archived version of the project for iTrace-Eclipse can be found here.\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"a4c9bc66c576f9e9d344eba6b4efeea4","permalink":"/project/eye-tracking/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/eye-tracking/","section":"project","summary":"An eclipse IDE-based plugin that implicitly gathers eye gazes and maps them to the IDE elements.","tags":["Eye Tracking"],"title":"Eye Tracking","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is an on-going project that involves building a sentiment analyzer that analyzes the sentiments behind the professor-reviews on RateMyProfessor. It also will be able to perform a sentiment analysis on the student evaluation forms submitted and other evaluation surveys conducted by Youngstown State University. The testing and training data was provided by Youngstown State University in the form of anonymous student evaluation data. The process involves tokenizing the dataset into words, filtering the stop-words (words that do not have polarity), and finally calculating the total polarity using Naive Bayes Classifier.\nCode Repository for the project\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"62fd26629cf36dbf7e5ac29b6fdbb0a0","permalink":"/project/nlp/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/nlp/","section":"project","summary":"Sentiment Analysis on professor-reviews","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Natural Language Processing","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project was focused around web crawling using a python library called Scrapy.

Initially, the deals were stored in a local server, but after integrating an automatic crawl scheduler (crawled data four times a day) the storage was shifted to an Amazon S3 server. Additionally, a recommender system was built that used k-NN to recommend deals to users based on their search preferences.\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"b20da4666754f01200d9b8d5c58eb98e","permalink":"/project/web-crawling/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/web-crawling/","section":"project","summary":"A web-crawler that crawls a website to fetch all the available deals.","tags":["Web Crawling"],"title":"Web Crawling","type":"project"}]
